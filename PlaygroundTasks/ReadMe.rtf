the problem with recursive approach in fibonacci series is it keeps repeating the same subproblems again and again 
it requires lot of efforts in getting result especially when count is large.

Therefore we follow iterative approach, here we store all the values in an array and avoid redundancy work. 
So, the function is directly returning the result from temp array we used.
